# AL Facade Pattern for External API Integration

## Overview

The facade pattern creates a unified, simplified interface to complex external API systems. Instead of exposing raw API complexity throughout your AL codebase, the facade provides a clean business-focused entry point that handles all technical implementation details internally.

**Core Principle**: One dedicated codeunit acts as the single gateway to external systems, abstracting authentication, error handling, retry logic, and data transformation.

## Strategic Framework

### When to Apply Facade Pattern
- **Multiple API endpoints** required for single business operation
- **Complex authentication flows** (OAuth, JWT, multi-step auth)
- **Inconsistent external API responses** requiring normalization
- **Rate limiting and retry logic** needed across multiple calls
- **Future API changes** anticipated requiring isolation from business logic

### Architecture Benefits
- **Dependency Isolation**: External system changes don't cascade through codebase
- **Simplified Testing**: Clear boundaries for mocking external dependencies
- **Centralized Logic**: Authentication, error handling, and retry patterns in one place
- **Business Focus**: Consuming objects work with business concepts, not technical APIs

## Architecture Focus

### Facade Structure
Create a dedicated codeunit containing:
- **Public Methods**: Business-focused operations (GetCustomerData, SyncOrderStatus)
- **Private Methods**: Technical API calls, authentication, error handling
- **Internal State**: Connection management, token caching, configuration

### Interface Design Principles
- **Business Language**: Method names reflect business operations, not API endpoints
- **Simplified Parameters**: Hide complex API parameter mapping from consumers
- **Consistent Returns**: Standardized response patterns regardless of underlying API variations
- **Error Abstraction**: Convert technical errors to business-meaningful messages

## Best Practices

### Implementation Guidelines
- **Single Responsibility**: Each facade handles one external system or related service group
- **Stateless Design**: Avoid maintaining connection state between method calls
- **Configuration Driven**: Use setup tables for URLs, credentials, and API versions
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Log all external interactions for troubleshooting

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Provide fallback behaviors when external systems unavailable
- **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures when external system is down
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Translate technical errors to actionable business guidance

## Anti-Patterns

### Avoid These Approaches
- **Direct API Calls** scattered throughout business logic objects
- **Shared HTTP Client** instances without proper abstraction layer
- **Exposed Technical Details** like HTTP status codes in business methods
- **Mixed Responsibilities** combining business logic with API communication
